# SoltraSplunk
This is a python script that runs on a Soltra Edge node. It should be scheduled to run at a regular interval. It pulls the latest indicators (ip addresses, domains, and email addresses) from the intel databse and writes them to a log file. This log file can then be monitored by a Splunk light fowarder so that they are sent to an indexer, providing your Splunk instance with fresh FS-ISAC intel!

# Usage
```
python soltrasplunk.py
```

# Requirements
Python 2.6+ (not guaranteed to work with Python 3)
Soltra Edge
