# Soltra2Splunk
This is a python script that runs on a Soltra Edge node. It should be scheduled to run at a regular interval. It pulls the latest indicators (ip addresses, domains, and email addresses) from the intel databse and writes them to a log file. This log file can then be monitored by a Splunk light fowarder so that they are sent to an indexer, providing your Splunk instance with fresh FS-ISAC intel!

Soltra Edge is an intelligence sharing platform used by FS-ISAC. More information: http://www.dtcc.com/news/2014/december/03/soltra
